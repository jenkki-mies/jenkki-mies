      - - Scholarly Bears research paper @ https://github.com/ernest-s/Neuromatch-ScholarlyBears#neuromatch-scholarlybears) 

FUTURE INTERESTS:
- 🌱 Own personal project @home in Finland, a python code solution for the online Caltech MOOC for Caltech CS 156 (https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) taught by professor يسر ابو مستفة (Yaser Abu-Mustafa). I got my BS in E&AS from Caltech in 1993/94, but this online class was created much later in 2012. I have a python implementations of perceptron learning algorithm homework assignments from CS156.  One of my first github repositories.
  - Code: https://github.com/jenkki-mies/Perceptron#perceptron
- 🛠️ Algorithms Toolbox taught by JetBrains on Coursera (partially finished)
  - I did all the free exercises but would like to do the entire course if I had more money).  It's based on PyCharm python.
  - Code available here: @ ️https://github.com/jenkki-mies/jenkki-mies
- ⭐Coursera astronomy at Caltech TODO: finish AY1 online class
- 🖖 I’m looking for an internship in connection with the full stack web development class (it's part of the class).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning research and applications.
- 🧠 Would like to work as a volunteer TA in the summer of 2024 (or later) for neuromatch teaching python / machine learning /mathematics /CNS
