- 👋 Hi, I’m @jenkki-mies
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning as applied to neuroscience, physics, and psychology.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on finishing an online MOOC from my alma mater, by Caltech professor 
يسر ابو مستفة (Yaser Abu-Mustafa), CS 156.  I got my BS in E&AS from Caltech in 1993, but this online class was created much later in 2012.
